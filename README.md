# Parallel Works Workflows

The home of the Parallel Works / ACTIVATE platform workflows.

**One workflow = one directory** under [`workflows/`](workflows/): the variant YAMLs
(in `yamls/`), the runtime files (scripts + support files, in `app/` or an
implementation subdir — the only subtree checked out at run time), README, build
tooling, marketplace thumbnails (in `thumbnails/`) and the recorded tests (in `tests/`)
all live together. There are **no version suffixes** — every file is the latest
version; git tags version the repo.

A workflow runs code on a resource and leaves something behind, and that is its
**shape**: most serve a web app through a **`pw` endpoint** that outlives the run
([webshell](workflows/webshell/) is the smallest); a **batch job** runs to completion
and fails when it fails ([activate-batch](workflows/activate-batch/),
[benchmarks](workflows/benchmarks/), [openfoam-naca](workflows/openfoam-naca/)); a
**callable step** runs on the login node for other workflows to call
([doe](workflows/doe/), [dakota](workflows/dakota/),
[design-explorer](workflows/design-explorer/)); a **composed** workflow is a YAML with
no code of its own that calls them ([doe-openfoam](workflows/doe-openfoam/),
[dakota-openfoam](workflows/dakota-openfoam/)); `*k8s*` variants serve the same endpoint
from a pod. The shapes, their rules and their combinations: [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md)
("Workflow shapes").

Apart from Kubernetes, they all work the same way: a controller script installs the
software into a shared directory on the login node, and the script that does the work
(a service, a batch job) is handed to the
[`script_submitter`](workflows/script_submitter/) subworkflow, which runs it on the
login node or submits it to the SLURM/PBS scheduler. Workflows call each other as
subworkflows rather than copying code.

How this repo was assembled, and where anything older lives, is recorded in
[MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md).

`librechat-singularity-manager` is a component of the librechat `-all` workflows
([workflows/librechat/librechat-singularity-manager/](workflows/librechat/librechat-singularity-manager/)).

**Shared subworkflows** (referenced by the workflow YAMLs via
`uses: github/parallelworks/workflows@canary` + `$yaml:`):

- [workflows/script_submitter/v3.6/](workflows/script_submitter/) — SLURM/PBS/SSH
  script submission, used by every workflow that runs a script on a cluster
- [workflows/wait_for_endpoint/](workflows/wait_for_endpoint/) — waits until an
  endpoint is listed and its URL answers, then releases the submitter; the health
  check every endpoint workflow owns

The sampler, the optimizer step, the case runner and the study page
([doe](workflows/doe/), [dakota](workflows/dakota/),
[openfoam-naca](workflows/openfoam-naca/), [design-explorer](workflows/design-explorer/))
are called the same way by the composed workflows.

**Shared tools** — [`tools/`](tools/) (`tools/oras`, `tools/utils`) are sparse-checked-out
next to `workflows/<name>` at runtime; scripts reference them as `tools/...` relative
to the run directory.

**Tests** — each workflow's end-to-end tests live under `workflows/<name>/tests/<variant>/`;
layout, runner and results are documented in [`tools/tests/README.md`](tools/tests/README.md).

**Tutorials** — [`tutorials/`](tutorials/) are staged, runnable lessons that build a
small demo app ([`demo-app/`](tutorials/demo-app/)) into a full workflow:
[`endpoint-workflows/`](tutorials/endpoint-workflows/) (the current `pw endpoints`
pattern, stages 1–7 incl. matrix fan-out, first-start-wins, and failover) and
[`session-workflows-hsp/`](tutorials/session-workflows-hsp/) (the same journey, HSP-flavored,
in the older form the upgrade playbook converts). [`optimization/`](tutorials/optimization/)
builds an iterative loop — propose designs, evaluate them in parallel, decide, repeat
until convergence — behind a file contract that `dakota-openfoam` fills with real tools.
[`if-conditions/`](tutorials/if-conditions/)
is a short standalone lesson on the `if:` status keywords (`always`, `never`, `completed`,
`error`, `canceled` and their negations) on steps and on jobs.

## Variants

`general` targets standard cloud/on-prem SLURM & PBS clusters. `emed`, `hsp`, and
`noaa` are the variants for the `cluster.einsteinmed.edu`, `activate.hpc.mil` and
`noaa.parallel.works` platforms, with their schedulers, defaults, and network
constraints; they also run on the cloud clusters of `activate.parallel.works`, which is
how they are tested (`tests/hsp/`, `tests/noaa/`). `*k8s*` variants
target Kubernetes clusters ([.claude/skills/activate-workflows/references/k8s-workflows.md](.claude/skills/activate-workflows/references/k8s-workflows.md)).

## Running a workflow

From a machine with the [`pw` CLI](https://parallelworks.com/docs/cli) authenticated:

```bash
pw workflows run "$PWD/workflows/webshell/yamls/general.yaml" -i '{"resource":"<cluster-name>","cluster":{"scheduler":false}}'
```

(Pass the YAML as an **absolute path** — the CLI parses relative paths as git hosts.)

When testing a workflow, also verify cleanup: cancel a run mid-flight and confirm
nothing is left behind (processes, scheduler jobs, containers), and delete test
endpoints when done — see [DeveloperGuide.md](DeveloperGuide.md).

What the run leaves behind depends on the shape: an endpoint workflow registers a
**`pw` endpoint** (`pw endpoints list`) that keeps serving after the run completes,
until `pw endpoints delete <name>`; a batch workflow runs its job to completion and
fails when it fails; a Kubernetes run stays alive and is torn down by cancelling it.
Note that workflow YAMLs pull this repo from GitHub at runtime
(`parallelworks/checkout` + subworkflow `uses:`), so local YAML edits only take full
effect once pushed to the referenced branch (**canary**).
