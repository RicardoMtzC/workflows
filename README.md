# Parallel Works Workflows

The home of the Parallel Works / ACTIVATE platform workflows.

**One workflow = one directory** under [`workflows/`](workflows/): the variant YAMLs
(in `yamls/`), the runtime files (`controller.sh`/`start-template.sh` + support files,
in `app/` or an implementation subdir — the only subtree checked out at run time),
README, build tooling, and marketplace thumbnails (in `thumbnails/`) all live together. There are **no
version suffixes** — every file is the latest version; git tags version the repo.
Every workflow but [activate-batch](workflows/activate-batch/), [3dcs](workflows/3dcs/)
and [benchmarks](workflows/benchmarks/) serves through the **`pw` endpoint pattern**;
those three run batch jobs to completion, as does [probe](workflows/probe/)'s
`general_run_tests.yaml`; [physicsnemo](workflows/physicsnemo/) runs its training to
completion and serves TensorBoard beside it.

How this repo was assembled, and where anything older lives, is recorded in
[MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md).

`librechat-singularity-manager` is a component of the librechat `-all` workflows
([workflows/librechat/librechat-singularity-manager/](workflows/librechat/librechat-singularity-manager/)).

**Shared subworkflow** (referenced by the workflow YAMLs via
`uses: github/parallelworks/workflows@canary` + `$yaml:`):

- [workflows/script_submitter/v3.6/](workflows/script_submitter/) — SLURM/PBS/SSH
  script submission used by every workflow

**Shared tools** — [`tools/`](tools/) (`tools/oras`, `tools/utils`) are sparse-checked-out
next to `workflows/<name>` at runtime; scripts reference them as `tools/...` relative
to the run directory.

**Tests** — each workflow's end-to-end tests live under `workflows/<name>/tests/<variant>/`;
layout, runner and results are documented in [`tools/tests/README.md`](tools/tests/README.md).

**Tutorials** — [`tutorials/`](tutorials/) are staged, runnable lessons that build a
small demo app ([`demo-app/`](tutorials/demo-app/)) into a full workflow:
[`endpoint-workflows/`](tutorials/endpoint-workflows/) (the current `pw endpoints`
pattern, stages 1–7 incl. matrix fan-out, first-start-wins, and failover) and
[`session-workflows-hsp/`](tutorials/session-workflows-hsp/) (the same journey, HSP-flavored,
in the older form the upgrade playbook converts). [`if-conditions/`](tutorials/if-conditions/)
is a short standalone lesson on the `if:` status keywords (`always`, `never`, `completed`,
`error`, `canceled` and their negations) on steps and on jobs.

## Variants

`general` targets standard cloud/on-prem SLURM & PBS clusters. `emed`, `hsp`, and
`noaa` are platform-deployment variants with their own schedulers, defaults, and
network constraints — they can only be run from those platforms. `*k8s*` variants
target Kubernetes clusters ([.claude/skills/activate-workflows/references/k8s-workflows.md](.claude/skills/activate-workflows/references/k8s-workflows.md)).

## Running a workflow

From a machine with the [`pw` CLI](https://parallelworks.com/docs/cli) authenticated:

```bash
pw workflows run "$PWD/workflows/webshell/yamls/general.yaml" -i '{"cluster":{"resource":"<cluster-name>","scheduler":false}}'
```

(Pass the YAML as an **absolute path** — the CLI parses relative paths as git hosts.)

When testing a workflow, also verify cleanup: cancel a run mid-flight and confirm
nothing is left behind (processes, scheduler jobs, containers), and delete test
endpoints when done — see [DeveloperGuide.md](DeveloperGuide.md).

Every endpoint workflow registers a **`pw` endpoint** (check `pw endpoints list`);
`activate-batch`, `3dcs` and `benchmarks` run their batch jobs to completion instead.
Note that workflow YAMLs pull this repo from GitHub at runtime
(`parallelworks/checkout` + subworkflow `uses:`), so local YAML edits only take full
effect once pushed to the referenced branch (**canary**).
