# DOE-OpenFOAM: Design of Experiments with Design Explorer

A design of experiments over the NACA 4-digit airfoil: a sampler spreads designs
over the variable bounds, or you paste your own, every design is solved in
parallel, and [Design Explorer](https://tt-acm.github.io/DesignExplorer/) shows
the inputs, the coefficients and the flow images of every design side by side.
Three standalone workflows do the work, called as subworkflows:

| Piece | Workflow | Called by |
|---|---|---|
| sample the designs | [`workflows/doe`](../doe/README.md) | the `preprocessing` job |
| solve one design | [`workflows/openfoam-naca`](../openfoam-naca/README.md) | the `workers` matrix, once per design |
| explore the results | [`workflows/design-explorer`](../design-explorer/README.md) | the `preprocessing` job, with images on |

Their READMEs describe the sampling methods, the case and the page; this one
covers the fan-out and the results. The matrix mechanics come from
[`tutorials/optimization`](../../tutorials/optimization/README.md).

## How the pieces connect

![general.yaml: preprocessing calls the doe workflow, which samples the designs into cases/, and the design-explorer workflow, which starts the server; the workers matrix calls openfoam-naca once per case; results collects every case into results.csv; the server reads cases/ on every request](thumbnails/doe-wiring.svg)

```
general.yaml
 ├─ preprocessing       checks the OpenFOAM and ParaView environments, then calls doe (the designs
 │                      into cases/) and, with images on, design-explorer (the page, once it answers)
 ├─ workers-1..n        matrix, if: job_id <= N_CASES — openfoam-naca on cases/case_<j>
 └─ results             if: always — every case into results.csv; fails only if none solved
```

The pieces share only the files under `cases/`: the sampler writes
`case_<j>/params.in`, each OpenFOAM call leaves `results.out` (or `exit_code` when
the solver failed) and `images/` next to it, and the collector and the page read
them. preprocessing reads the number of designs back from `cases/doe.env`.

## Sampling

**Sampling method**, **Number of cases**, **Random seed** and **Design
variables** go to [`workflows/doe`](../doe/README.md), whose README has the
methods and the rules for pasting your own cases. **Number of cases** is also
the width of the workers matrix, so with your own cases set it to at least the
table's row count; surplus slots are skipped for free.

**The names connect the pieces.** Each line of **Design variables** names one of
openfoam-naca's case fields: `max_camber`, `camber_position`, `thickness` or
`angle_of_attack`. The sampler writes those names into every `params.in`, and
openfoam-naca reads them by name ([its design names](../openfoam-naca/README.md#design-names)).
A pasted table's header uses the same names.

- Leave a variable out of **Design variables**, and every case uses
  openfoam-naca's default for it, such as 5° for the angle.
- With **Your own cases (CSV)**, a variable that is in **Design variables** but
  has no column in the table gets the middle of its bounds in every case. With
  `thickness 0.08 0.18` and no `thickness` column, every case uses 0.13.
- A name misspelled in **Design variables** fails every case with an error that
  lists openfoam-naca's four names. A table column that matches no variable
  stops the run earlier, in the sampler.

## The Design Explorer page

With **Generate images** on (the default), every case renders its flow fields
with ParaView and [`workflows/design-explorer`](../design-explorer/README.md)
serves the study at the endpoint `design-explorer-<run slug>`, whose README
describes the page. It shows each case as soon as it solves.

![The page: axis toggles and input sliders at the left, the selection tools above the parallel coordinates of the four inputs and the three outputs, the thumbnails of the solved designs below, bordered in the color of their drag coefficient](../design-explorer/thumbnails/design-explorer.png)

The endpoint keeps serving after the run ends, until
`pw endpoints delete design-explorer-<run slug>`. With **Generate images** off
there are no images and no page; the results table is still written.

## Running it

Pick the resource, the sampling method, the number of cases and **Cases at a
time**, and choose login node or scheduled cases. The defaults run 8 Latin
hypercube designs at `mesh_scale` 2 on the login node, images on. **Load saved
inputs → `mesh3_slurm_4ranks`** runs 16 Sobol designs as SLURM jobs of 4 ranks
at the converged mesh, `mesh_scale` 3. On a login node, keep **Cases at a time**
× **Cores per case** within its cores.

The run succeeds when at least one case solved. A case whose solver diverged is
a `FAILED` row of the table, a result of the study, and the run lists it in a
warning.

## What a run leaves

In the run's job directory on the cluster:

```
cases/
├── doe.csv, doe.env      the sampled designs, and their count
├── case_1/ ... case_n/   one openfoam-naca case each:
│   ├── params.in           the design
│   ├── results.out         Cd and -Cl (or exit_code alone when the solver failed)
│   ├── case/case.foam      the solved case, for ParaView
│   └── images/             pressure, velocity, streamlines, turbulence, wake, mesh
├── results.csv           every case: status, inputs, Cd, Cl, Cl/Cd
└── data.csv              the solved cases, as the page reads them
```

## Files

This directory has no `app/`: the sampler, the page and the study reader belong
to [`workflows/doe`](../doe/README.md) and
[`workflows/design-explorer`](../design-explorer/README.md), which check out
their own. preprocessing checks out `workflows/openfoam-naca/app` and
`tools/utils` for the environment checks, and `workflows/design-explorer/app` for
the results job's `study.py`.
