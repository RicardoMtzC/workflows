# Runs on the LOGIN (head) node, as a second step of the detect job, and does
# two things the compute-node probe cannot:
#
#   1. Records the head node's own parameters. Every build happens here, so its
#      microarchitecture, OS image and toolchain decide what gets compiled --
#      yet until now only the worker's parameters were ever written down. When a
#      stack misbehaves on the worker, the first question is how the two nodes
#      differ, and that was unanswerable after the fact.
#
#   2. Diffs its headers against the worker's. A header present on the worker
#      but missing HERE cannot be linked against during the build, even though
#      the hardware supports the feature -- the classic split-image failure, and
#      one that otherwise surfaces as a configure error hours into a compile.
#      That case fails the run immediately and loudly.
#
# The reverse case -- present here, missing on the worker -- is reported as a
# warning rather than an error: it builds fine and may still run, because the
# runtime library can be present while only the -devel headers are absent. It
# is logged because it is the shape of a genuine runtime failure and is worth
# seeing before someone spends a day on it.
