# This is the only check in the workflow that can distinguish a correct stack
# from one that cannot run. Everything else -- the build exiting 0, the endpoint
# answering HTTP -- passes identically either way. Run fair-mastodon proved it:
# it passed every recorded criterion while 45 specs in the environment, three
# GROMACS builds among them, carried skylake_avx512 (AVX-512) instructions that
# the zen2 worker cannot execute. `spack install` succeeded because compiling
# AVX-512 on an AVX-512 login node is perfectly legal; only running the result
# on the worker reveals it.
#
# It therefore has to be its own job. The build runs on the LOGIN node, where
# the wrong ISA executes fine -- so a check there proves nothing. This script is
# submitted to the scheduler so it lands on the same class of hardware the stack
# was built for.
#
# A binary built for the wrong microarchitecture dies on SIGILL (exit 132),
# which is called out by name because that exit status is the entire point of
# this check.

# partition, so the script is ALREADY executing on a worker -- srun would only
# add a launcher that cannot start half of these binaries. On this platform
# `srun --mpi=list` offers none, cray_shasta and pmi2, with no pmix plugin, and
# OpenMPI 5 dropped native PMI2 in favour of PMIx: `srun ./gmx_mpi` therefore
# cannot launch the two OpenMPI-linked GROMACS builds (the CUDA one among them),
# though they run perfectly standalone via singleton init. That SLURM has
# libpmi2.so but no slurm/pmi2.h or pmix.h is the same split the header probe
# reports -- the runtime is there, the headers to build against are not.
#

# cannot do singleton init (MPICH). No PMI negotiation is involved either way.

# If this landed on the same host that ran the build, nothing about the worker
# was exercised and the check must not imply otherwise. Happens when the cluster

# Two distinct verdicts, because they mean different things:

#   other_failures -- the binary started but its MPI could not initialise here
#                     (no OFI provider, no process manager, ...). Real, worth
#                     seeing, but a property of the launch environment rather
#                     than of what was compiled -- so it warns instead of
#                     failing, or every cluster without an EFA device would fail
