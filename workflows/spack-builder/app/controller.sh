# controller.sh — login-node setup for the Spack MPI-stack build.
#
# Runs on the login/controller node (the node with internet) before anything is
# submitted, and is idempotent: safe to re-run against an existing install.
#
#   1. bootstrap Spack at ${service_install_prefix}
#   2. warm the package repo (Spack v1.2 fetches it lazily on first use)
#   3. reconcile site externals against this image
#   4. register the system compiler that bootstraps the stack compiler
#   5. create and register the binary build cache mirror
#
# Consumes (from the sourced inputs.sh):
#   app_dir                        workflows/spack-builder/app, relative to the run dir
#   service_install_prefix         Spack root (must be on a shared filesystem)
#   service_spack_version          git tag; must be v1.x
#   service_buildcache_path        directory-backed binary mirror
#   service_use_public_buildcache  "true" to also register Spack's public binary cache
#
# Every config write is pinned to the *site* scope ($SPACK_ROOT/etc/spack) rather
# than the default user scope (~/.spack). Two reasons: the user scope would leak
# between separate install prefixes on the same account, and the site scope
# travels with the shared install so worker nodes read the same settings.
