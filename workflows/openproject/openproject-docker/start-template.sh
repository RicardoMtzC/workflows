# Interactive Session Service Starter - OpenProject
#
# Purpose: Start the OpenProject all-in-one container (web, worker, PostgreSQL,
#          memcached) in Docker behind a pw endpoint on a pinned subdomain, with
#          ACTIVATE seeded as an OpenID Connect provider when the form carries
#          an OIDC client
# Runs on: Controller or compute node
# Called by: Workflow after controller setup
#
# Required Environment Variables:
#   - pw_endpoints_args: Arguments for pw endpoints run (--name, ...)
#   - service_rundir: holds pgdata/, assets/, .secret_key_base and .lock
#   - service_image: the openproject/openproject image
#   - service_subdomain: subdomain label of the URL (default openproject-<PW_USER>)
#   - service_enterprise_token_file: optional; an OpenProject Enterprise token to import
#   - oidc_client_id, oidc_client_secret, oidc_display_name: optional ACTIVATE OIDC client
