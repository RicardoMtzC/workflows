# OpenProject

[OpenProject](https://www.openproject.org/) project management (work packages, boards,
Gantt, wiki, meetings, time tracking) served through a `pw` endpoint named
`openproject-<run-slug>` on a **pinned subdomain**, with **Sign in with ACTIVATE**
through the platform's OpenID Connect provider. Two runtimes, chosen with **Run
container using**: **Singularity** (default) runs everything as your user from one
prebuilt SIF; **Docker** runs the official all-in-one image as root. The run completes
once OpenProject's login page answers; the service runs until
`pw endpoints delete openproject-<run-slug>`, which stops PostgreSQL, OpenProject and
nginx, or removes the container. A new run directory starts with OpenProject's default
administrator, `admin` / `admin`, which must be changed at the first login.

## How it works

Both runtimes pin the endpoint's subdomain (default `openproject-<your username>`, so
the URL is the same on every run) and probe `/login` before the run completes. The
platform proxy forwards `X-Forwarded-Proto: http`, under which OpenProject's HTTPS mode
redirects every page to itself and drops its Secure session cookie, so each runtime puts
a proxy in front of the app that sets `X-Forwarded-Proto: https`.

- **Singularity** (`openproject-singularity/`): `controller.sh` pulls
  `ghcr.io/parallelworks/openproject:17.0` (the official `openproject/openproject:17-slim`
  image plus PostgreSQL 17 and nginx from Debian, built from `openproject.def` with
  `build-container.sh`) into `<install dir>/containers/`. `start-template.sh` runs, as
  your user and from that one image, PostgreSQL on a loopback port (data in the run
  directory, a generated password), the seeder (schema, migrations, seed data, the OIDC
  provider), puma, the `good_job` worker and nginx on the endpoint port; PID files and
  `cancel.sh` stop them. No root, no Docker daemon; the image's writable paths are bound
  from the run directory. A node that cannot mount SIF images gets a sandbox unpacked once.
- **Docker** (`openproject-docker/`): `start-template.sh` pulls the image and starts
  `openproject/openproject:17` (web, worker, PostgreSQL, memcached in one container, as
  root) with an Apache vhost (and `mod_headers`) mounted in that sets the header.
  `cancel.sh` removes the container. Needs Docker, directly or through `sudo`.
- With a **Client ID** and **Client secret**, the app gets ACTIVATE as an OpenID
  Connect provider through OpenProject's `OPENPROJECT_OPENID__CONNECT_ACTIVATE_*`
  environment variables (issuer `https://<platform host>/api/oidc`, endpoints from the
  platform's discovery document, scopes `openid profile email`, login mapped from
  `preferred_username`, email from `email`). The image seeds them into the database on
  every boot, so a changed secret takes effect on the next run.

## Sign in with ACTIVATE

1. **Register the application** (an organization administrator, once). Turn on the
   *OIDC Applications* feature preview in your account settings, then open
   Organization → Settings → Applications and add a **web** application with the
   redirect URI below: the page shows the client ID right away and the client secret
   once you create one (shown a single time; an admin can reveal it again later). The
   platform docs at <https://parallelworks.com/docs> do not cover this page yet. The
   same registration through the API:

   ```bash
   pw api -X POST organizations/<org>/oidc/apps --input - <<'EOF'
   {"name": "OpenProject", "kind": "web", "consent": "none", "subjectType": "username",
    "scopes": ["openid", "profile", "email"],
    "redirectUris": ["https://<subdomain>.<sessions domain>/auth/activate/callback"],
    "postLogoutRedirectUris": ["https://<subdomain>.<sessions domain>/"]}
   EOF
   pw api -X POST organizations/<org>/oidc/apps/<clientId>/secrets   # shown once
   ```

   The redirect URI is matched exactly, so it carries the subdomain the workflow pins:
   `openproject-<username>` by default (`openproject-alvaro.activate.pw` on
   activate.parallel.works), or the form's **Subdomain**. Reserve the label with
   `pw subdomains reserve <label>` so no other user can claim it.
2. **Launch** with the client ID and secret in the *Sign in with ACTIVATE* group.
3. **OpenProject shows SSO buttons only with an active Enterprise edition token**
   (its `sso_auth_providers` feature; Community edition filters every OpenID Connect
   and SAML provider out at login, logging `OmniAuth SSO strategy activate is only
   available for Enterprise Editions`). The provider is configured either way. To
   see the button: paste a token into the form's **OpenProject Enterprise token** (the
   launcher imports it once; the run directory's database keeps it), or start a free
   trial under Administration → Enterprise edition, which stores it the same way.
4. The platform's session proxy rewrites any redirect to another host onto the
   OpenProject host, which would send the browser to `<OpenProject>/api/oidc/authorize`
   instead of the platform. The Singularity runtime's nginx therefore answers such a
   redirect with a small page that navigates to the platform itself; the Docker runtime
   (Apache inside the image) cannot, so Sign in with ACTIVATE needs the Singularity
   runtime until the proxy is fixed.
5. Open OpenProject in its own tab (`https://<subdomain>.<sessions domain>/`). Inside
   the platform's embedded session view the app sits in an iframe on another site: the
   browser withholds the platform's cookie from it and the platform refuses to start a
   sign-in in a frame (`login_required`), so the ACTIVATE button fails there.
6. Users sign in with the **ACTIVATE** button on `/login`; a first sign-in creates
   their OpenProject account from the ID token (login = ACTIVATE username). ACTIVATE
   releases `name` but no family name, so OpenProject asks a new user to complete the
   last name once. Sign-out ends the ACTIVATE session too (RP-initiated logout) and
   returns to the OpenProject URL.

## Form options

- **Run container using**: Singularity (default) or Docker, see above. A run directory
  belongs to one runtime: Docker's is written as root and the container's postgres user,
  and the Singularity runtime refuses it.
- **Subdomain** (empty = `openproject-<username>`): the label of the OpenProject URL,
  kept the same on every run. Two OpenProjects of one user (two clusters) need two
  labels, each registered as its own redirect URI.
- **Run directory** (default `${HOME}/openproject`): `pgdata/`, `assets/`, the generated
  secrets; under Singularity also `tmp/`, `log/` (PostgreSQL, puma, worker, nginx and
  seeder logs), `files/`, `run/` (PID files) and `nginx/`. Singularity writes it as your
  user; Docker as root and its `postgres` user, so removing a Docker run directory needs
  `sudo rm -rf`. One run per run directory at a time (a lock file); a second run on the
  same directory fails and leaves the first one running.
- **OpenProject image** (Docker only, default `openproject/openproject:17`): keep the
  major version of an existing run directory; a new major may need the PostgreSQL data
  upgraded first. The Singularity image is pinned in `openproject-singularity/controller.sh`.
- **Sign in with ACTIVATE** group, all optional:
  - **Client ID**: the registered application; empty = no ACTIVATE sign-in is
    configured, OpenProject's own accounts only, and the two fields below stay hidden.
    The provider is written into the database on every start and stays there, so a
    later run without a client ID keeps the stored one (remove it under Administration
    → Authentication → OpenID providers).
  - **Client secret** and **OpenProject Enterprise token**: shown once a client ID is
    typed and checked when the run starts: the secret is always required, the token
    until the run directory holds an imported one. The sign-in button is hidden until
    OpenProject holds a valid Enterprise edition token (Community edition hides every
    SSO provider); the launcher imports the token into the run directory's database
    the first time and only checks it afterwards.
    The token is bound to the OpenProject host name and has an expiry date; a free
    trial requested inside OpenProject is stored the same way.

## Variants

`general.yaml` offers both runtimes. `hsp.yaml` (activate.hpc.mil) and `noaa.yaml`
(noaa.parallel.works) carry those platforms' scheduler forms and submitters, run the
Singularity runtime only (the runtime input is hidden) and take the platforms' install
directories: `${PROJECTS_HOME}/hsp` on HSP, the shared software directory or the
form's **Install directory** on NOAA (`${HOME}/pw` on a cloud cluster). Register the
OIDC application on that platform; the issuer follows `PW_PLATFORM_HOST`.

## Requirements

Singularity: `singularity`/`apptainer` on the service node (loaded through `module` when
not in the PATH), `python3`, and internet access on the login node for the first pull of
the SIF (about 0.5 GB). Docker: Docker on the service node (directly or through `sudo`)
and internet access there on the first launch (the image is 3.3 GB on disk). Either way
about 4 GB of memory. The first boot of a run directory initializes PostgreSQL and seeds
the database (about two minutes on gcptest); later boots take under a minute.
OpenProject serves at the root of its address, so the endpoint is a subdomain one; on a
platform without session subdomains (`--no-subdomain`) the launchers pass the endpoint
path as `OPENPROJECT_RAILS__RELATIVE__URL__ROOT` (untested).

## Building the Singularity image

```bash
cd workflows/openproject/openproject-singularity
./build-container.sh                       # singularity build --fakeroot from openproject.def
tools/oras/oras push ghcr.io/parallelworks/openproject:17.0 openproject.sif
```

A new tag for a new OpenProject major; keep the package public (anonymous pulls).
