# OpenProject

Runs [OpenProject](https://www.openproject.org/) (work packages, boards, Gantt, wiki,
meetings, time tracking) on a cluster and serves it as a `pw` endpoint on a fixed
subdomain. Users can sign in with their ACTIVATE account.

```
form ──► preprocessing ──► start script ──► OpenProject ──► https://<subdomain>.<sessions domain>/
         (checkout,         (PostgreSQL,     answers /login    the run completes; the service
          checks)            app, proxy)                       runs until you delete the endpoint
```

The first login is `admin` / `admin`; OpenProject asks you to change it right away.

## Two ways to run it

| Run container using | What runs | Needs |
|---|---|---|
| **Singularity** (default) | PostgreSQL 17, OpenProject and nginx from one image, `ghcr.io/parallelworks/openproject:17.0`, all as your user | `singularity`/`apptainer`, about 0.5 GB for the image |
| **Docker** | The official all-in-one image `openproject/openproject:17`, as root | Docker (directly or through `sudo`), 3.3 GB for the image |

Both keep the database and attachments in the **Run directory** (`${HOME}/openproject`),
so a later run on the same directory finds its projects and users again. A run
directory belongs to one runtime: Docker writes it as root, Singularity as you.

The first start of a run directory takes about two minutes (database setup); later
starts under one.

## Sign in with ACTIVATE

OpenProject hides every single sign-on provider unless it holds an **Enterprise
edition token** (a free trial from Administration → Enterprise edition works). With a
token, this is how to connect it to ACTIVATE:

1. **Pick the address, then register an application for it** (organization admin,
   once). An application is registered for one exact redirect URI, and that URI is
   built from the OpenProject address, which the form's **Subdomain** decides:
   `https://<subdomain>.<sessions domain>/auth/activate/callback`. With the default
   subdomain on activate.parallel.works, that is
   `https://openproject-<user>.activate.pw/auth/activate/callback`. Launching with
   another subdomain later means registering (or updating) the application for the
   new address, or the sign-in stops at a redirect URI error.

   Turn on the *OIDC Applications* preview in your account settings, open
   Organization → Settings → Applications and add a **web** application with that
   redirect URI. You get the client ID at once and the client secret when you create
   one (shown a single time; an admin can reveal it again). The platform docs do not
   describe this page yet. The same through the API:

   ```bash
   pw api -X POST organizations/<org>/oidc/apps --input - <<'EOF'
   {"name": "OpenProject", "kind": "web", "consent": "none", "subjectType": "username",
    "scopes": ["openid", "profile", "email"],
    "redirectUris": ["https://<subdomain>.<sessions domain>/auth/activate/callback"],
    "postLogoutRedirectUris": ["https://<subdomain>.<sessions domain>/"]}
   EOF
   pw api -X POST organizations/<org>/oidc/apps/<clientId>/secrets
   ```

2. **Launch** with the client ID, the client secret and the Enterprise token in the
   *Sign in with ACTIVATE* group. The token is imported once per run directory.
3. **Sign in** with the ACTIVATE button on the login page. A first sign-in creates the
   OpenProject account (login = ACTIVATE username) and asks for the last name once.

Two things to know:

- Open OpenProject in its own tab (`https://<subdomain>.<sessions domain>/`). Inside
  the platform's embedded session view the sign-in cannot complete.
- Use the Singularity runtime for it. The platform proxy rewrites the redirect to the
  sign-in page; the Singularity runtime's nginx works around that, the Docker runtime
  cannot yet.

## Form

| Field | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Run container using | Singularity | See above |
| Subdomain | `openproject-<username>` | Decides the address, and with it the redirect URI the application must be registered for. Reserve it with `pw subdomains reserve <label>` |
| Run directory | `${HOME}/openproject` | Database, attachments, logs. One run at a time |
| OpenProject image | `openproject/openproject:17` | Docker only. Keep the major version of an existing run directory |
| Client ID | empty | Empty = OpenProject accounts only. A provider stays in the database once configured; remove it under Administration → Authentication |
| Client secret | | Required with a client ID |
| OpenProject Enterprise token | | Required with a client ID until the run directory holds one; bound to the subdomain, has an expiry date |

## Building the Singularity image

```bash
cd workflows/openproject/openproject-singularity
./build-container.sh        # the official slim image plus PostgreSQL 17 and nginx
tools/oras/oras push ghcr.io/parallelworks/openproject:17.0 openproject.sif
```

New OpenProject major, new tag. Keep the package public.
