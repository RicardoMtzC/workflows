# Resume support for simulator.sh, which sources this file: everything that lets
# an interrupted OpenFOAM case continue where it stopped instead of starting over,
# so that a workflow can resubmit the case until it completes
# (yamls/<variant>-restart.yaml). The case directory is the cwd and the
# OpenFOAM case is ./case; the state is plain files, readable by hand:
#
#   attempts.log                 the history: one start and one end line per attempt
#   attempt.lock                 held by the running attempt's process tree (flock)
#   case/restart/inputs          the design and the settings the case was built
#                                from: a case is only resumed when they match
#   case/restart/<stage>.done    the stages finished (blockMesh, decomposePar,
#                                potentialFoam, simpleFoam), each with the attempt
#                                that finished it: a finished stage is skipped
#   case/restart/failed          the stage that failed on its own (a diverged
#                                solver): the case is never solved again
#   case/restart/solver.attempt  the attempt that ran simpleFoam last; its log is
#                                kept as case/log.simpleFoam.<attempt> when the
#                                next one starts
#
# A checkpoint is a time directory simpleFoam wrote (every CHECKPOINT_EVERY
# iterations, the last KEEP_CHECKPOINTS kept). It is complete when every field of
# 0/ is in it ending with OpenFOAM's closing line, in every processor directory of
# a decomposed case: a write cut short by a kill is discarded, and the solver
# restarts from the one before. An interruption is a signal (the scheduler's
# walltime, the platform canceling the attempt) or a lost node: the signal is
# trapped, passed on to the running tool and recorded with the attempt's exit
# status 128 + signal; a lost node leaves no record, which the next attempt notes.
# A tool that stops on its own with a non-zero status failed: that is recorded as
# final and no later attempt solves the case again.
