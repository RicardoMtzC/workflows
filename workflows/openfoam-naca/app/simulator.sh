#!/bin/bash
# OpenFOAM per-case driver, run inside one case directory: reads ./params.in (one
# "<value> <name>" line per design variable — the NACA 4-digit parameters
# max_camber, camber_position, thickness), builds a C-grid airfoil case from the
# airFoil2D tutorial (Spalart-Allmaras, freestream at ALPHA_DEG incidence,
# Re = 1e6), runs blockMesh + potentialFoam + simpleFoam, and writes
# ./results.out (one "<value> <label>" line per objective, both minimized:
# f1 = drag coefficient, f2 = -lift coefficient, from the forceCoeffs function
# object). The write is atomic; on any error the process exits non-zero and leaves
# no results.out, which is the failure signal. The solved case stays in ./case
# with an empty case/case.foam next to it, so it opens directly in ParaView; a
# decomposed case is reconstructed first.
#
# Environment: ALPHA_DEG (default 5) is the angle of attack. MESH_SCALE (default
# 1) multiplies every cell count — the cost dial. CORES_PER_CASE (default 1) > 1
# decomposes the mesh and runs the solvers under ${MPIRUN} (default `mpirun
# --bind-to none -np <ranks>`); the ranks are capped so that each keeps at least
# MIN_CELLS_PER_RANK cells (default 1000, 0 disables the cap): 16 ranks on the
# 5400-cell base mesh diverged for a marginal design that converged serially, on
# 4 ranks and on 16 ranks of a finer mesh (Nautilus, 2026-10-05). A user-set
# MPIRUN carries its own rank count, so it is only warned about, never changed.
# OPENFOAM_ENV names a file sourced to
# put OpenFOAM (and mpirun) on PATH; unset, the conda env that
# install-openfoam.sh creates is activated. Every OpenFOAM step's full output
# goes to case/log.<step>; the short steps are also streamed to stdout, and the
# solver streams one progress line (iteration, pressure residual, Cd, Cl) every
# STREAM_EVERY iterations (default 50; 0 streams its whole log). DECOMP_METHOD
# (default hierarchical: x-strips) selects the decomposePar method.
#
# Checkpoints and resuming (restart.sh, sourced below, has the mechanics and the
# state files): CHECKPOINT_EVERY (default 0: only the last iteration is written)
# makes simpleFoam write its fields every N iterations, keeping the last
# KEEP_CHECKPOINTS (default 2) of them. RESUME=true continues a ./case built from
# the same design and settings: the mesh, the decomposition and the potentialFoam
# initialization are kept once done, simpleFoam restarts from its latest complete
# checkpoint, a solved case is not solved again and neither is one whose solver
# failed on its own; a case built from other inputs starts over. Every run is one
# attempt in ./attempts.log, and a signal (the scheduler's walltime, a cancel)
# ends the attempt as interrupted, exit status 128 + signal, for the next one to
# continue. Without RESUME the case always starts from scratch.
