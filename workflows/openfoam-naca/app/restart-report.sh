# Usage: OUTPUTS=<file> [CASE_DIR=<dir>] restart-report.sh
#
# The Report step of the restart variants (<variant>-restart.yaml), one script
# for the three, run with if: always(): the run's verdict comes from the case
# directory, never from how the retried Solve step ended. Solved is the only
# success, whether the loop stopped by decision or by exhausting its retries;
# the failures are told apart: the case failed on its own (a diverged solver,
# final), the simulator failed before opening the case (the inputs, the node's
# environment: final), no attempt ever ran the simulator (the case workflow
# failed before it), or the case is still interrupted after the attempts ran
# out (resumable: a later run given this directory continues it).
# Environment: OUTPUTS (the file the workflow collects KEY=value outputs from),
# CASE_DIR (the case.case_dir input; empty: the attempts' default, case/ in the
# directory they ran in, the one this copy of the app was checked out to),
# MAX_RESTARTS and MESH_SCALE (for the messages).
