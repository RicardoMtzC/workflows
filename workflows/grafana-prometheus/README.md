# Grafana + Prometheus

[Grafana](https://grafana.com/oss/grafana/) over a [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/)
server, in Docker on a compute cluster, served through a `pw` endpoint named
`grafana-<run-slug>`. Prometheus scrapes the node that runs the stack
([node-exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter): CPU, memory, disks, file
systems), its GPUs when it has them
([dcgm-exporter](https://github.com/NVIDIA/dcgm-exporter), with the GPU dashboard
provisioned), any scrape targets typed into the form and, on request, the platform
agent's experimental exporter on the login node. The run completes once the endpoint answers; the
containers run until `pw endpoints delete grafana-<run-slug>`. Visitors are signed in
anonymously as Admin (the platform login protects the endpoint); the `admin` account
takes the form's **Admin Password**.

## How it works

- `app/controller.sh` checks the form's values on the login node.
- `app/start-template.sh` runs on the login node or in a SLURM/PBS job: pulls the
  images, writes the Prometheus configuration and runs the stack with Docker Compose
  behind `pw endpoints run`. Grafana, Prometheus and node-exporter run as your user, so
  the data directories belong to you; dcgm-exporter joins the stack when `nvidia-smi`
  sees a GPU and Docker has the NVIDIA runtime. With **Platform Agent Metrics** on and
  the stack on the login node, a second platform agent of your user runs inside the
  endpoint's process tree with `--experimental-prometheus-exporter` on port 9091, and
  Prometheus scrapes it as the `pw-agent` job.
- `app/grafana/provisioning/` holds the Prometheus datasource and the GPU dashboard
  (NVIDIA's DCGM exporter dashboard); it is copied into the Run Directory on every
  start, so a dashboard edited in Grafana is kept in Grafana's database, not there.

## Form options

- **Run Directory** (default `${HOME}/grafana-prometheus`): `data/prometheus/` (the time
  series), `data/grafana/` (users, dashboards, settings), `prometheus/prometheus.yml`
  and `grafana/provisioning/` (generated on every start). Reuse it to keep the metrics
  history and the dashboards; only one run at a time can serve it.
- **Admin Password** (default `changeme`): set when the Run Directory is first
  initialized; later runs keep the current one, which you change in Grafana.
- **Prometheus Retention** (default `15d`): how long the metrics are kept.
- **Platform Agent Metrics** (default off): the platform agent's experimental exporter,
  login node only. Inside a run that agent has no platform credentials, so it only
  serves the login node's CPU, memory and storage (`pw_agent_*`), which node-exporter
  reports in more detail, and it listens on an SSH server and proxy port of its own.
- **Extra Scrape Targets**: one `host:port` per line, scraped as the `extra` job. A
  service on the host that runs the stack is `host.docker.internal:<port>` from inside
  the containers.
- **Grafana Image** (default `grafana/grafana:13.2.3`), **Prometheus Image** (default
  `prom/prometheus:v3.15.0`). node-exporter and dcgm-exporter are pinned in the YAML.

## Requirements

Docker with the Compose plugin on the service node (directly or through `sudo`), and
internet access there on the first launch. Grafana serves at the root of its address,
so the endpoint must be a subdomain one (the default). Run Directories from the
`grafana-prometheus` workflow have `data/` owned by the images' users; `sudo chown -R`
them to reuse them.
