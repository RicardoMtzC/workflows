## What changes conceptually

| | v4 (sessions) | v5 (endpoints) |
|---|---|---|
| Exposure | `sessions:` block + `session_runner/v1.4` reverse tunnel; URL under `/me/session/<user>/<name>/<slug>` | service wraps itself in `pw endpoints run` (or a `pw-cli` sidecar on k8s); subdomain URL `https://<name>.activate.pw/<slug>` |
| Base path | apps that build absolute URLs need base_url config or an nginx proxy | **none needed** — subdomain endpoints serve at the root (delete the nginx/base-path machinery) |
| Auth | platform login on the session URL | same: endpoints are **platform-authenticated by default** (anon → `307` login redirect), so `token=''`/`--auth=none` keeps v4's trust model |
| Port | `session_runner` allocates `${service_port}` | `pw endpoints run` assigns it — reference it as the literal **`{port}`** token (also env `PORT`), never `${port}` |
| Submission | `session_runner` (wraps script_submitter) | **`script_submitter/v3.6` directly** — preprocessing does the controller + script assembly itself |
| Lifecycle (non-k8s) | run alive for the session's life | run **completes** once the endpoint registers; service outlives it; teardown = `pw endpoints delete <name>` (kills the remote process tree) |
| Lifecycle (k8s) | run alive streaming logs | unchanged — run stays alive; **cancel run = teardown** ([k8s-workflows.md §2](k8s-workflows.md)) |

Endpoint name convention: **`<service-name>-${PW_RUN_SLUG}`** — built in preprocessing,
polled in `wait_for_endpoint`. Both jobs see the same value because `PW_RUN_SLUG` is
run-scoped, and it reaches compute nodes via the `inputs.sh` `env | grep '^PW_'` capture.

## Step 1 — `controller-v4.sh` (copy from `controller-v3.sh`, then strip)

- Delete everything that existed only to serve the session: **nginx** (sif download,
  configs), **Juice**, base-path helpers.
- Keep the actual install logic (download/conda/etc.), idempotent as before.
- Keep the final "executable exists or `exit 1`" check.

## Step 2 — `start-template-v4.sh` (the real rewrite)

Contract differences vs v3:
- **No `cancel.sh`, no `sleep inf`, no port allocation.** The YAML prepends a generic
  cleanup trap; `pw endpoints run` runs the server in the **foreground** and is itself
  the thing that keeps the job alive.
  - **Exception:** if the service spawns a daemon that escapes the endpoint's process
    tree (webshell's shared `screen` session), DO write a `cancel.sh` that kills it —
    the generic trap runs `./cancel.sh` on teardown, and `script_submitter`'s
    `define_cleanup_script: true` + `cleanup_script_path: ./cancel.sh` runs it on
    cancel-before-ready. Write it to the script's CWD (relative `> cancel.sh`): the
    script runs from `subworkflows/session_runner/step_0/`, which is also where the
    trap and the cleanup step look. Verified: `pw endpoints delete` → tree killed →
    trap fires → screen quit (webshell live run).
- Launch shape (see `jupyterlab-host/start-template-v4.sh`, `openvscode/start-template-v4.sh`):
  ```bash
  pw endpoints run ${pw_endpoints_args} -- <server-cmd> --port {port} ...
  if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
      echo "::error title=Error::pw endpoints command failed"
      # Fail loud (exit non-zero): the submitter job fails and the workflow's
      # cancel-jobs step stops wait_for_endpoint
      exit 1
  fi
  ```
- **Delete base-path handling** on subdomain platforms. Jupyter's config shrinks to
  root_dir + `allow_remote_access` + auth; no `basepath`, no nginx. Path-based
  endpoints (`--no-subdomain`, required on emed) keep a base path equal to
  `/me/session/${PW_USER}/<endpoint name>` (or the `{path}` token /
  `PW_ENDPOINT_PATH` when the app is launched by `pw endpoints run`).
- **Apps that build absolute URLs** (n8n's `N8N_EDITOR_BASE_URL`/`WEBHOOK_URL`) read
  the public URL from **`PW_ENDPOINT_URL`**, exported by `pw endpoints run` to the
  wrapped command (also exported: `PORT`, `PW_ENDPOINT_HOST`, `PW_ENDPOINT_PATH`).
  Since these are unknown before launch, generate a **launcher script** that
  references `${PORT}`/`${PW_ENDPOINT_URL}` and run
  `pw endpoints run ${pw_endpoints_args} -- ./launch-<svc>.sh` — this also sidesteps
  nested-quoting pain for container commands (verified: n8n logs "Editor is now
  accessible via <endpoint URL>").
- **Daemon-owned services need `cancel.sh`** (exception to "no cancel.sh"): anything
  that escapes the endpoint's process tree — webshell's `screen`, docker containers
  (owned by dockerd) — gets a `cancel.sh` that kills it; the generic trap runs it on
  teardown. For docker, keep a foreground `docker logs -f <name>` as the endpoint's
  liveness process and name the container by `${PW_RUN_SLUG}` (the port is unknown
  when `cancel.sh` is written). Write `cancel.sh` to the script's CWD.
- **Singularity SIF vs sandbox:** ship a SIF (ORAS artifact on ghcr) and test
  `singularity exec <sif> /bin/true` **in the start template** (the execution node —
  login vs compute support can differ); on failure build a sandbox once:
  `singularity build --fakeroot --force --sandbox <dir> <sif>` with
  `SINGULARITY_TMPDIR`/`SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR` under `${HOME}` (both paths verified on
  gcpsmall, n8n conversion). Full build/push/convert recipe:
  [singularity-sif-containers.md](singularity-sif-containers.md).
- Password/token: optional password → hash it (`jupyter_server.auth.passwd` via a
  python heredoc — avoids shell-quoting the `$`-laden hash); none → `token = ''` is
  fine because the endpoint already requires platform login.

## Step 3 — `general_v5.yaml` (diff your `general_v4.yaml` against openvscode/jupyterlab v5)

1. **Delete the top-level `sessions:` block.**
2. **Create Inputs**: drop `basepath=` and Juice lines; add
   `pw_endpoints_args="--name ${{ inputs.service.name }}-${PW_RUN_SLUG} --slug <slug>"`
   (slug examples: `lab`, `?folder=${{ inputs.service.directory }}`, `""`).
3. **Add two preprocessing steps** (copy verbatim from a v5): *Controller
   Preprocessing* (cat inputs.sh + controller-v4.sh, run it inline) and *Create
   Service Script* (inputs.sh + generic cleanup trap heredoc + start-template-v4.sh;
   emits `SCRIPT_PATH` and `SKIP_CLEANUP_PATH` outputs).
4. **Replace the session_runner `with:` block** with `script_submitter/v3.6`:
   `use_existing_script: true`, `script_path: ${{ needs.preprocessing.outputs.SCRIPT_PATH }}`,
   `define_cleanup_script: true`, `cleanup_script_path: ./cancel.sh`,
   `submit_and_exit: false`, `skip_cleanups_file: ${{ needs.preprocessing.outputs.SKIP_CLEANUP_PATH }}`,
   plus the same `scheduler`/`slurm`/`pbs` mappings as v4.
5. **Add the `wait_for_endpoint` job**: poll `pw endpoints list` for the name every
   10 s; on success `touch` the SKIP_CLEANUP file and `parallelworks/cancel-jobs` the
   submitter — that's what lets the run complete while the service lives on — and end
   with the `Check endpoint health` step (copy it from
   `workflows/jupyterlab/yamls/general.yaml`): the workflow must verify the URL
   answers (Bearer `PW_API_KEY`, per-service healthy codes and budget) and delete the
   endpoint + fail the run when it does not. Path-based endpoints list a path: prefix
   it with `https://${PW_PLATFORM_HOST}` (see the emed/hsp variants).
6. Form: keep the v4 `cluster`/`service` groups; drop the `juice` group.
7. `parallelworks/checkout` → your **dev branch** while testing; **flip to `main`
   after merge** (both openvscode and jupyterlab needed this follow-up).

## Step 4 — the Kubernetes half (`general_k8s.yaml`, standalone `k8s.yaml`)

The v4 k8s pattern — a top-level `sessions:` block (`useCustomDomain: true`) and a
`create_k8s_session` job calling `parallelworks/update-session` with a `targetInfo` of
`{name: <cluster>, namespace, resourceType: services, resourceName: <app>-lb}` — makes
the platform tunnel into a k8s Service itself. It still works (verified 2026-09-16: the
session URL is `externalHref` in `pw sessions ls -o json`), but it is not the repo
pattern. On top of Step 3 (the sidecar itself: [k8s-workflows.md §2](k8s-workflows.md)):

1. Replace the `sessions:` block with `env: {PW_API_KEY: ${PW_API_KEY}}`.
2. Delete the Service (unless another pod needs it) and the `create_k8s_session` job.
3. Add the sidecar to the Deployment, and the **Create API Key Secret** step with its
   `cleanup:` before the Deployment apply; `--all-containers` on the log stream.
4. Add `wait_for_endpoint_k8s` (copy it from any k8s YAML) and a hidden
   `service_k8s.name` as the endpoint prefix.
5. Hybrids: guard every cluster-only **job** with a job-level
   `if: ${{ inputs.resource.type != 'kubernetes' }}`; a step-level guard is not enough
   (why: [k8s-workflows.md §6](k8s-workflows.md)).
6. Prefer a container-agnostic launch (`command:` plus the port from `image_port`) over
   image-specific entrypoint scripts.
7. Dry-run, run, cancel, check the namespace is empty; add the test
   ([k8s-workflows.md §5](k8s-workflows.md)).

Done 2026-09-16 for the three hybrids and the five standalone files.

## Step 5 — Test end to end (what "done" means)

```bash
pw workflows run --dry-run -i '{"cluster":{"resource":"<name>","scheduler":false}}' /abs/path/general_v5.yaml
pw workflows create <wf> --yaml /abs/path/general_v5.yaml     # ABSOLUTE path (see gotcha)
pw workflows run <wf> -i '{"cluster":{"resource":"<name>","scheduler":false}}' --name t1 -o json
```
Then verify, in order:
1. `pw endpoints list` shows `<service>-<run-slug>` **running** with its URL, and the
   `Check endpoint health` step log (`pw workflows runs logs <slug> --job
   wait_for_endpoint`) shows the status it accepted.
2. Non-k8s: the **run completes** on its own (wait_for_endpoint fired); the service
   process (`pw endpoints run … -- <server> --port <realport>`) is alive — `{port}`
   was substituted with a number.
3. `curl localhost:<realport>/<slug>` returns the app (200/expected title); the
   public URL returns `307 → …?sessionRedirect=…` for anonymous curl (platform auth).
4. Teardown: non-k8s `pw endpoints delete <name>` kills the process tree; k8s
   `pw workflows runs cancel <slug>` deletes deployment/secret/PVC and the endpoint
   drops off `pw endpoints list` within seconds.
5. k8s CLI runs need the resource **object** (compute-resources doesn't hydrate bare
   names): `{"id":"<pw kube ls id>","name":"<k8s-cluster>","type":"kubernetes","uri":"pw://<name>"}`.

## Discovering v5 endpoint sessions programmatically (verified)

In `pw sessions ls -o json`, an endpoint session has `type: "endpoint"`,
`openAI` set by `--openai`, its **local port in `software.port`** (top-level
`remotePort` is 0), and **no `targetName`/`targetType`** — the hosting resource
is not recorded. A workflow that must be found by another agent therefore tags
itself via `--description` (returned verbatim in the session row): the agent
fleet uses `--description agent-worker:<cluster>`, and `agent-orchestrator`'s
`discover_workers()` accepts both this and the v4 tunnel-session shape
(verified live: workspace orchestrator → lite-agent endpoint worker on gcpsmall,
full ask_cluster round trip).

## Gotchas checklist (each one bit a real run)

- **Step `cleanup:` runs when its JOB ends — on success too — not at workflow end**
  (verified 2026-07-29, librechat hsp_v5 run 00001). A preprocessing-step cleanup
  guarded by `[ -f "${PWD}/SKIP_CLEANUP" ]` always fires before `wait_for_endpoint`
  can touch that file, so it deleted the librechat_dir lock while the service ran.
  Guard job-scoped cleanups with a completion marker the job's LAST step writes
  (`touch PREPROCESSING_DONE`; see `librechat-container/hsp_v5.yaml`) — only
  cross-job cleanups (e.g. session_runner's) can use the SKIP_CLEANUP file.
  `hsp-all_v5.yaml`'s librechat Lock cleanup still carries the broken guard.
- **hsp conversions of services that used `session_runner/v1.4/hsp.yaml` must
  replicate its shared-install-dir step**: derive `service_parent_install_dir` from
  `PROJECTS_HOME` (`${PROJECTS_HOME}/hsp`, falling back to `${HOME}/pw`) in
  preprocessing — `script_submitter` does not compute it (copy the block from
  `hsp-all_v5.yaml` / `librechat-container/hsp_v5.yaml`).

- **The endpoint proxy preserves the public Host header** (`<name>.activate.pw`).
  An app with a DNS-rebinding/host guard (hermes dashboard v0.17+) passes every
  local curl and then 400s "Invalid Host header" for real users — and the
  anonymous-curl 307 check does NOT catch it (auth redirects before the app).
  Fix: `pw endpoints run --rewrite-host=localhost`. Catch it pre-launch with
  `curl -H "Host: <public-domain>" localhost:<port>` (verified: hermes-agent).

- `{port}` **token, not `${port}`** — shell expands `${port}` to empty before `pw`
  sees it and the app falls back to its default port.
- `pw workflows create/update --yaml <path>`: an unreadable path still creates the
  workflow **empty**; always pass absolute paths.
- `pw workflows run` uses the **stored** definition — `update` after every YAML edit.
- Checkout `branch:` left pointing at a merged-and-deleted dev branch breaks future
  runs — flip to `main` right after merge.
- On k8s, cancel the run; `pw endpoints delete` tears nothing down
  ([k8s-workflows.md §2](k8s-workflows.md)).
- Don't hand-verify with `--dry-run` alone; the four checks in Step 5 are the test.
- The ttyd bundled in `downloads/vnc/noVNC-1.3.0.tgz` is a 1.7.1 fork with a
  `-R/--readonly` flag — **writable by default**, unlike upstream ttyd ≥1.7 which is
  read-only without `-W`. No writable flag needed (verified over the ws protocol).
- A root-slug service (webshell) just omits `--slug` from `pw_endpoints_args` —
  `--slug ""` risks the empty token being eaten by the arg parser.
- **Smoke-testing the public endpoint URL from a script** (verified, rag-service):
  `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"` against `https://<sub>.activate.pw/...`
  returns the app's response (200) where anonymous gets the 307 login redirect.
  The token is the runtime `PW_API_KEY` inside a workflow, or the `token` field of
  `~/.config/pw/credentials` on a node where the CLI is logged in. Cookie-style
  (`pw-token=`) and `X-API-Key` headers do NOT work.
- **A backgrounded sibling process** (e.g. an indexer started by the start template
  before `pw endpoints run`) dies with the tree on `pw endpoints delete` when the
  generic trap + a `cancel.sh` (written to the script CWD with the child's PID) are
  in place — verified live with rag-service; don't rely on tree-kill alone.

## Appendix — the v4 session mechanism (for reading the YAMLs you convert)

Nothing in this repo uses it any more; these are the facts needed to recognise it.

**Top-level `sessions:` block** — named session objects the workflow creates, referenced
as `${{ sessions.<key> }}`:
```yaml
sessions:
  session:                 # arbitrary name; reference as ${{ sessions.session }}
    useTLS: false          # service speaks plain HTTP
    redirect: true         # after launch, redirect the user to the Sessions page
    # useCustomDomain: ${{ inputs.resource.type == 'kubernetes' }}  # SaaS *.activate.pw
```
The session is filled in at run time by the `parallelworks/update-session` action
(target/name/slug/remoteHost/remotePort; on k8s a `targetInfo` naming a Service — Step 4)
and reached at `https://<platform-host>/me/session/<user>/<session-name>/<slug>`, i.e.
under a URL prefix. Apps that build absolute URLs therefore needed
`basepath=/me/session/${PW_USER}/${{ sessions.session }}` as their base URL (JupyterLab:
`c.ServerApp.base_url`, plus `default_url`/`static_url_prefix`), or an nginx reverse proxy
on `${service_port}` rewriting the prefix and setting the WebSocket upgrade headers, unless
they honoured `X-Forwarded-Prefix` (the tunnel forwarded it; verified with Hermes'
dashboard). None of that survives the conversion: subdomain endpoints serve at the root
("What changes conceptually").

**Session name** = `<workflow-name>_<runNumber>_<sessionKey>` (the `sessions:` key is the
trailing part) — matching the key marker was the stable way to find a workflow's sessions
at runtime. `pw sessions ls -o json` gives per session: `name`, `status`, `targetName`
(`<ns>/<cluster>` or `workspace`), `targetType`, `remoteHost`, `remotePort`, `localPort`,
`openAI`, `externalHref` (the URL), `workflowRun.{name,slug,number}`.

**CLI**
```bash
pw sessions ls [-o table|json] [-t desktop|vscode|tunnel]
pw sessions create --type tunnel --remote-port <P> <resource> [--name N] [--open] [--connect --port <L>]
pw sessions open <name>            # open in browser
pw sessions connect <name>         # local port-forward
pw sessions stop <name>            # 404s if the run was already canceled (cancel tears the session down): not an error
```
A running tunnel session shows `STATUS=running`, `TYPE=tunnel`, `REMOTE HOST`, `REMOTE PORT`.

**`openAI: true` sessions — the v4 chat surface.** A session declared `openAI: true`
(`redirect: false`; `detach: true` to persist past the run) registered its tunneled
`GET /v1/models` + `POST /v1/chat/completions` service as a model in the built-in chat.
Where it surfaced depended on where the session ran (verified): a **workspace** session
became chat **models** (`pw ai models ls` lists `session:<user>:<session-name>/<model-id>`;
chat via `pw ai chats` or the web UI); a **cluster** session became a chat **provider**
(`pw ai providers ls`, `csp: openai-tunnel`; the web Chat polls its `/v1/models`) — not in
`pw ai models ls`, and `pw ai chats` may not target it. Both worked in the built-in chat
([Session Tunnels](https://parallelworks.com/docs/ai/ai-providers/session-tunnels)), so a
cluster agent needed no workspace proxy. One session could expose many models (each
`/v1/models` entry registered, and the list was re-polled); the hermes orchestrator
advertised itself plus one `hermes-<cluster>` model per worker. A flaky agentic session
