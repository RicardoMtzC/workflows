# Conda environments on login nodes (sudo-free software)

## Miniforge, not Miniconda

- Bootstrap Miniforge from its GitHub release (`Miniforge3-Linux-x86_64.sh -b -p
  <prefix>`); it defaults to conda-forge and avoids repo.anaconda.com's terms of
  service. Check every download and installer's exit status.
- Idempotence: `<prefix>/bin/conda --version` for the bootstrap (a binary a cut
  install left behind is not a conda), then `conda run -n <env> <tool> --version`
  (or `-help`) before `conda create`, so a re-run finds a working env and skips. An
  install a walltime or an attempt budget cuts short is the reason for the markers
  below: `tools/utils/miniforge.sh` marks the prefix while it bootstraps and
  `install-openfoam.sh` the env while it creates it, and only a marked one is
  removed and redone (2026-10-16).
- Keep several envs in one prefix under
  `${service_parent_install_dir:-$HOME/pw/software}/<workflow>/miniforge`, and any
  post-install repair (a missing symlink, a variable the activation forgets) in the
  installer so re-runs apply it to existing installs too.
- **conda-forge stacks activate incompletely:** check the variables a tool's own
  `etc/bashrc` would have set (OpenFOAM's `FOAM_TUTORIALS`, see
  [openfoam.md](openfoam.md)) and derive what is missing after `conda activate`.

## Activating inside a run

- `source <prefix>/etc/profile.d/conda.sh && conda activate <env>` — put these two
  lines in one file that preprocessing writes and every later step and case sources
  (`tools/utils/prepare-env.sh`); absolute paths work on compute
  nodes because the home filesystem is shared. Validate it in preprocessing by
  sourcing it in a fresh `bash -c` and checking `command -v <tool>`.
- `conda run -n <env> <cmd>` is fine for one-off checks; do not wrap a long-running
  service in it (it buffers output and adds a wrapper process to kill).

## Login nodes that block repo.anaconda.com (hsp `jean`): ship a prebuilt env

A download that runs under `nohup` with its output sent to a file is never checked, so
the failure surfaces 80 lines later as "command not found". Check every download and
installer, and ship the fallback as a conda-pack tarball on ghcr
(`workflows/jupyterlab/build-conda-artifact.sh`, pulled with `oras_pull_file`). Packing
a Miniconda root prefix works (`--exclude 'pkgs/*' --exclude 'envs/*'`); run the
generated `conda-unpack` as `<prefix>/bin/python <prefix>/bin/conda-unpack` because its
`#!/usr/bin/env python` shebang finds no `python` on RHEL 8 (verified in a Rocky 8
container). Build with `CONDA_OVERRIDE_GLIBC=<target>` and `PIP_ONLY_BINARY=:all:`, and
whitelist pure-Python sdists (`PIP_NO_BINARY=jupyterlab-slurm`) that publish no wheel.
Pull it through `tools/oras/libs.sh:oras_pull_file` (retries; anonymous first — a stale
ghcr login in `~/.docker/config.json` makes `oras pull` say `denied` for a public
package). Mark every prefix the installer creates and `rm -rf` only marked ones; an
unmarked prefix that already serves the tool is reused, not refused: the hsp form's
default directory still held the native Miniconda from before the marker existed, and
refusing it failed every default run there (2026-10-06).

## Concurrent installers and long prefixes

- Several workers of one run may install into the same prefix at once (an
  optimization loop's evaluators on a cold cluster). `tools/utils/miniforge.sh`
  `miniforge_lock <prefix>` takes an `flock` on `<prefix>.lock` before the
  "already installed?" check and holds it until the installer exits, so exactly
  one worker downloads and the rest find the env when their turn comes (verified
  2026-10-01 with four concurrent `install-openfoam.sh`: one log has the download
  and the 118-package bootstrap, three have none). Keep the check inside the lock.
- **A prefix path longer than ~110 characters breaks `bin/conda`:** the Miniforge
  installer then writes `#!/usr/bin/env python` instead of the absolute interpreter
  path (the kernel caps a shebang at 127 bytes), so `conda` runs under whatever
  `python` is on PATH and fails with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'conda'`
  (verified 2026-10-01 in a 116-character scratch prefix; the same installer under
  `~/pw/software/<workflow>/miniforge` is fine). Keep `service_parent_install_dir`
  short, or call `<prefix>/bin/python -m conda` if a long path is unavoidable.
