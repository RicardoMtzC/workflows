## Install without sudo

- `conda create -n openfoam openfoam=2412` into a Miniforge prefix (~5 min once);
  idempotence check `conda run -n openfoam simpleFoam -help`. Pattern:
  `workflows/openfoam-naca/app/install-openfoam.sh` + `tools/utils/miniforge.sh`
  (Miniforge itself: [conda-environments.md](conda-environments.md)).
- **Activation is incomplete:** the package does not export `FOAM_TUTORIALS` — derive
  it as `${CONDA_PREFIX}/tutorials` after `conda activate` (verified 2026-09-29).
  Check every `FOAM_*`/`WM_*` variable you rely on the same way.
- A site install works through the same code path: `module load openfoam/2412` or
  `source /opt/openfoam2412/etc/bashrc` typed into the form becomes one sourceable
  file that every case sources (`tools/utils/prepare-env.sh`).
- **DSRC modules only point at OpenFOAM** (Nautilus, 2026-10-05): `module load
  openfoam/Intel/v2512` loads Intel compilers + OpenMPI 5.0.1 and sets `foamDotFile`
  (`/p/app/openfoam/OpenFOAM-v2512/etc/bashrc-icx`), printing "Issue the command source
  $foamDotFile"; `blockMesh` is on PATH only after that `source`. The form snippet is
  therefore two lines, saved as the `nautilus_modules` configuration of the HSP forms
  (`workflows/openfoam-naca/yamls/hsp.yaml`, `workflows/dakota-openfoam/yamls/hsp-naca.yaml`).
  `module show` shows the pattern before a run does: `setenv foamDotFile`, no PATH change.

## Parallel runs (`-parallel`)

- **Symptom: `The dummy Pstream library cannot be used in parallel mode`** on every
  `mpirun ... <solver> -parallel` (verified 2026-09-30). The conda package ships its MPI
  Pstream under `lib/mpich-3.3` while the binaries' RPATH (and `FOAM_MPI`) name
  `lib/sys-mpich`, so the loader falls back to `lib/dummy`. RPATH beats
  `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, so the fix is a link of the expected name to the real directory,
  made idempotently on every run so existing installs get it too
  (`install-openfoam.sh`, `f_link_mpi_pstream`). Confirm with
  `ldd $(command -v simpleFoam) | grep Pstream`.
- The env's MPI is **MPICH 4.3 with the hydra `mpirun`**; `decomposePar` has scotch,
  metis and kahip available (`ls $FOAM_LIBBIN | grep Decomp`).
- **Do not default to `method scotch`: this build's scotch partitions differently on every
  call** (the `cellProcAddressing` checksum changed on each of 30 runs, 2026-09-30), so a
  design near the stability edge converges or diverges by the draw — 1 divergence in 30
  login-node runs, 4 lost cases in ~33 on the compute nodes' CPUs, and the same design
  passing one attempt and failing the next. A geometric method (`hierarchical`,
  `n (N 1 1)`) is deterministic (identical coefficients on every repeat), needs no
  library on a site install, and converged for every design tried; on the small C-grid
  it was also faster at 2 ranks (5.9 s vs 7.5 s). PCG/DIC instead of GAMG for `p` did not
  help — the partition, not the linear solver, is the variable.
- **Watching it run:** solver output redirected to a file shows nothing in the platform's
  streamed job log; tee the short steps and filter the solver into one line per N
  iterations (`Time`, first `Solving for p` residual, and Cd/Cl from a `forceCoeffs`
  function object with `log yes` — v2412 prints them as a tab-separated table, `Cd:` then
  the total). `workflows/openfoam-naca/app/simulator.sh`, `foam_solve`.
- **Launcher:** `mpirun --bind-to none -np N`. Hydra and OpenMPI both accept the flag;
  without it, concurrent launchers on one node (a login node running `batch_size` cases
  at once) all pin their ranks to the same first cores. Let the sourced environment
  export `MPIRUN` to replace the launcher (`srun --mpi=pmix` on a site that wants it)
  and validate the launcher's first word, not `mpirun`, in preprocessing.
- **Chain:** `blockMesh` → `decomposePar` → `mpirun ... potentialFoam -parallel` →
  `mpirun ... simpleFoam -parallel`. Function objects (`forceCoeffs`) write to
  `case/postProcessing` from the master rank, so objectives need no `reconstructPar`.
- **Over-decomposition diverges marginal designs** (Nautilus, 2026-10-05, the workflow's
  own simulator on one compute node, Intel icx and Gcc builds of v2512 identical):

  | design | ranks | mesh_scale | cells/rank | result |
  |---|---:|---:|---:|---|
  | NACA 2412 | 1, 16 | 1 | 5400, 337 | Cd 0.0222/0.0223, Cl 0.722 |
  | camber 0.050 | 1, 4 | 1 | 5400, 1350 | Cd 0.0287, Cl 1.068 |
  | camber 0.050 | 16 | 1 | 337 | **SIGFPE in `GaussSeidelSmoother` before iteration 100**, Cd 952 at iteration 50 |
  | both | 16 | 3 | 3037 | converged |

  The simulator therefore caps the ranks at one per `MIN_CELLS_PER_RANK` cells (default
  1000) after `blockMesh`, from the `nCells` line of its log, and leaves a user-set
  `MPIRUN` alone with a warning (`workflows/openfoam-naca/app/simulator.sh`). Rank count is
  a stability variable on this C-grid, not just a speed one.
- **Under SLURM** one node per case, `--nodes=1 --ntasks=N`: hydra launches its ranks
  locally inside the allocation (verified 2026-09-30 on gcpsmall's 4-core nodes, two
  2-rank cases packed per node). PBS: `-l select=1:ncpus=N:mpiprocs=N`.
- **When it pays** (gcpsmall login node, NACA 2412 C-grid, simpleFoam + SA):

  | cells | 1 core | 2 ranks | 4 ranks |
  |---:|---:|---:|---:|
  | 5.4k | 6.5 s | 8.6 s | — |
  | 21.6k | ~1 min | — | 29 s |

  Below ~15k cells per rank decomposition loses to halo exchange; keep the default at
  1 core and let the user raise it with the mesh. Rank results agree with serial to
  within 0.5% on Cd.
- A mid-run cancel (submitter kills the `run.sh` process group) leaves no `mpirun`,
  `hydra_pmi_proxy` or rank behind even though hydra puts them in their own process
  groups: the proxies exit when their control connection drops (verified 2026-09-30).

## Checkpoints and restarts (`workflows/openfoam-naca/yamls/general-restart.yaml`, 2026-10-16)

- `writeControl timeStep; writeInterval N; purgeWrite K` keeps the last K time
  directories **written by this run only**: a restart starts with an empty purge stack,
  so earlier attempts' checkpoints survive it; prune them yourself
  (`restart.sh`, `restart_checkpoints`). `startFrom latestTime` resumes a decomposed case
  too (each `processor*/` has the same times).
- **A torn write has no closing line.** Fields are written one after another into
  `<time>/` (and `uniform/time` first, so it proves nothing); a kill mid-write leaves a
  field missing or truncated. A checkpoint is complete when every field of `0/` is in it
  ending with `// ****` (checked in every processor directory); keep `purgeWrite` ≥ 2 so
  a torn latest checkpoint still leaves a complete one (verified by truncating `600/U`:
  discarded, resumed from 500).
- `forceCoeffs` writes a new `postProcessing/forceCoeffs1/<startTime>/coefficient.dat`
  per start: merge the files in start order, later values winning for the iterations
  solved twice (`sorted(glob)[-1]` sorts "1000" before "200").
- `potentialFoam` rewrites `0/U` in place: a kill during it leaves a broken initial
  field. Rewrite `0/` from the template (and redo the decomposition) unless potentialFoam
  finished on them.
- OpenFOAM handles SIGINT/SIGQUIT/SIGSEGV/SIGFPE, not SIGTERM: a SIGTERM ends the solver
  at once with no `FOAM FATAL` in the log, so "non-zero and no signal seen" is the
  solver's own failure. A rank's SIGFPE under hydra shows as `Foam::sigFpe::sigHandler`
  in the stack trace, `Caught signal 8`, then `BAD TERMINATION ... EXIT CODE: 9` and
  `mpirun` exiting 137 (the other ranks are killed). Every log opens with
  `trapFpe: Floating point exception trapping enabled (FOAM_SIGFPE).`: a grep for
  "Floating point" must skip that banner.
- The over-decomposition divergence reproduces on gcptest's login node: camber 0.05,
  mesh_scale 1, 16 ranks with `MIN_CELLS_PER_RANK=0` dies of SIGFPE in seconds, while
  serial it converges (Cd 0.0276, Cl 1.040); the restart workflow's failure-path test
  uses it. Camber 0.06 at 12° with thickness 0.08 or 0.18, and even thickness 0.6,
  converged serially: the serial solver is hard to break on purpose.

## Numerics that bit

- **The same design can converge on one node type and diverge on another** (SIGFPE in
  `simpleFoam` around iteration 170 on gcpsmall's compute nodes; 800 clean iterations
  on its login node, serial and 4-rank alike, 2026-09-30): high-camber airfoils at the
  default mesh sit close to the stability edge, and floating-point differences between
  CPU types tip them. Treat divergence as a per-design result the optimizer absorbs
  (`FAIL`), not as an infrastructure failure to retry.

- On the C-grid an impulsive uniform start of SIMPLE diverges at every design point:
  initialize with `potentialFoam` first (`fvSolution` needs a `Phi` solver block).
- Finer meshes need a larger iteration cap and softer relaxation (`p` 0.25, `U`/`nuTilda`
  0.5 from `mesh_scale` 2); scale `endTime` with the mesh rather than fixing it.
- Write `0/U` wholesale when the freestream changes: a `foamDictionary` edit of
  `internalField` alone leaves the `$internalField` macros of the boundary
  conditions expanded to the old value.
